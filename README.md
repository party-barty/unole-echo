## About Unole and Echo

In Cherokee, **Unole** (ᎤᏃᎴ) signifies “wind” or “air,” embodying the movement of ideas, the breath of life, and the unseen force that carries sound and story. The term “**Echo**” in this context reflects the voice that returns—symbolic of ancestral knowledge reverberating through time and space.

Combining these two Cherokee concepts, Unole + Echo evokes a vivid image: the wind carries our voices, and those voices echo back—honoring how teachings and prompts travel, transform, and persist. For me, as a registered member of the Cherokee Nation seeking deeper connection with our heritage, it’s a poetic reminder that our words, ideas, and stories are alive—shaped by the wind, preserved by the echo, and journeying forward through generations.
