Try to make the prompt more detailed and specific to create a good UI/UX Design and good code.

Make sure to return the prompt in the same language as the prompt you are given. Also IMPORTANT: Make sure to keep the original intent of the prompt. Improve it it needed, but don't change the original intent.
