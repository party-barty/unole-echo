I need you to design and build a professional B2B website for Vision Equipment, a manufacturer’s representative firm that has served municipal water and wastewater customers across Texas for nearly 25 years.

Target Audience:
Engineers (environmental and mechanical), plant managers, superintendents, operators, and maintenance staff from municipalities in Texas.

Website Goals:
- Provide information about the manufacturers Vision Equipment represents.
- Demonstrate expertise and credibility in municipal water and wastewater treatment solutions.
- Generate leads through clear calls-to-action (e.g., contact reps, download resources).
- Educate engineers and municipal staff through blog posts, project case studies, and manufacturer product information.

# Pages & Requirements:
1) Home: 
- Clear overview of Vision Equipment’s value proposition.
- Primary CTA: Contact a Rep.
- Secondary CTA: Explore Manufacturers.
- Brief intro to solutions and process areas.

1) About Vision Equipment: "/about.html"
- single page template. 
- suggested sections: Hero (About Vision Equipment); Intro with Featured Stats; Our Story; Our Approach / Process; Industry Leading Manufacturers; Core Values; Meet the Team; Social Proof;

2) Manufacturers: "/manufacturers.html"
- Grid or list of represented manufacturers with logos, descriptions, core products/solutions, and BABA compliance notes.
- Links to each manufacturer’s official site.

3) Projects: "/projects.html"
- Showcase municipal projects, upgrades, and installations across Texas.
- Each project should highlight the problem, solution, and equipment provided.

4) Blog (Archive): "/blog.html"
- Organized by category (e.g., Headworks, Aeration, Clarification, Solids Handling, Disinfection, Optimization).
- Designed for SEO and easy browsing.

5) Blog Post (Single Template): "/blog/single-post-demo.html"
- Optimized layout with featured image, headings, CTAs (e.g., “Contact a Rep” or “View Related Manufacturers”).
- sidebar on right with Recent Updates and Categories list.
- show Breadcrumbs before the main post content. ex: "Blog > {Primary Category}"

6) Contact Us
- Contact form with fields (Name, Email, Company/Utility, Role, Message).
- Schema markup for Local Business/Contact Page.
- Clear CTA to connect with sales reps.

7) Privacy Policy
- reuse the main body cotent from https://visionequipment.net/privacy-policy/

8) Landing Page
- CTA: Download our white paper “How to Reduce Operating Costs by Retrofitting Wastewater Treatment Equipment.”
- main content is 2 columns. Left column has main body text. Right column always contains a lead form to capture Name, Email, Company, and Role before download.
- Persuasive copy targeting engineers and plant managers.


Tone & Style:
- Professional, technical, and engineer-focused.
- Clear, concise, and skimmable.
- Incorporate trust signals: years in business, Texas focus, and manufacturer partnerships.
- Avoid overly salesy language; emphasize technical expertise and reliability.

Additional Notes:
- Use a clean, modern design with blues, greys, and water-inspired accents.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and tablet.
- SEO optimized with structured headings, metadata, and schema.
- Accessibility best practices followed.
- it looks like the class "bg-primary" is not working yet or has not been styled. can we set the property "background" equal to the value of the "colors.primary" attribute in tailwind theme?
- is tailwind imported to every page or just homepage? it looks like its not working on Manufacturers and Projects
